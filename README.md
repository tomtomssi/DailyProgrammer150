Telephone Keypads commonly have both digits and characters on them. This is to help with remembering & typing phone numbers (called a Phoneword), like 1-800-PROGRAM rather than 1-800-776-4726. This keypad layout is also helpful with T9, a way to type texts with word prediction.
Your goal is to mimic some of the T9-features: given a series of digits from a telephone keypad, and a list of English words, print the word or set of words that fits the starting pattern. You will be given the number of button-presses and digit, narrowing down the search-space.
